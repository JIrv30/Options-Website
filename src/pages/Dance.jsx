          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Dance uses movement symbolically as a fundamental form of human expression. It is both empowering and powerful as a form of non-verbal communication. The intrinsic value of dance lies in the development of creative, imaginative, physical, emotional, and intellectual capacities. Dance is both physical and expressive â€“ this is what makes it similar to, yet different from, other art forms and physical activities. Dance also supports learning across various subjects, building confidence, resilience, and supporting literacy through its written assessments.

            BTEC Dance is an exciting and challenging course in which students will develop performance and technique skills, choreography tools, and dance analysis skills. The written work completed as part of the BTEC develops evaluative and research skills essential for further education. BTEC Dance also offers a vocational aspect, providing career-related briefs that prepare students for a future career in Dance.
            <br /><br />
            Although contemporary dance is the predominant style studied, students will also participate in workshops exploring styles such as street, samba, and ballet. They will also analyze the work of professional choreographers who have created choreography in various styles, as part of their Component 1 research.
            <br /><br />
            Students will have the opportunity to attend theatre trips and dance events throughout the course. While no prior dance training is required, a keen interest in dance is essential. Additional rehearsals outside of school may be necessary, particularly when working toward final assessed performances. Commitment is key to success.
