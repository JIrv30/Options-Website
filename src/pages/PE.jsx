        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg">
          <li>Develop theoretical knowledge and understanding of the factors that underpin physical activity and sport and use this knowledge to improve performance</li>
          <li>Understand how the physiological and psychological state affects performance in physical activity and sport</li>
          <li>Perform effectively in different physical activities by developing skills and techniques and selecting and using tactics, strategies, and/or compositional ideas</li>

          <li>Understand key socio-cultural influences which can affect peopleâ€™s involvement in physical activity and sport</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-lg">
          All pupils who opt for this course have an additional five hours of Physical Education per week. The practical element makes up 30% of the final mark and requires the pupils to demonstrate practical capabilities in three sports (2 individual and 1 team or vice-versa) from an approved list.
          <br />
          It is essential that anyone who chooses this course participates regularly in at least one activity (preferably two or three) out of school.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          The theoretical component is worth 60% of the final mark. Pupils sit two external examinations based on their subject knowledge and understanding of the following topics:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg">
          <li><strong>Paper 1:</strong> Applied anatomy and physiology, Physical training</li>
          <li><strong>Paper 2:</strong> Socio-cultural influences, Sports Psychology, Health, fitness, and well-being</li>

          The GCSE course should be considered by those pupils seeking to study Physical Education at A-level and/or those pupils who wish to study a more sports science approach to physical education. The nature of the course and practical assessment requires pupils to be participating in sporting activity to a good standard on a regular basis, and preferably be competing in sport outside of school hours.
